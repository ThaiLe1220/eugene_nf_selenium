Randall: Hello. Today I’m interviewing Joshua on his experiences going to a Japanese school. Now Joshua, what time do you go to school?		
Joshua: Eight O’clock.		
Randall: Eight O’clock. And do you go by yourself, or on a school bus?		
Joshua: No, I have a group that goes with me.		
Randall: So you go with a group?		
Joshua: Uh-huh.		
Randall: Now what kinds of things do you take to school?		
Joshua: I take my taiso fuku, that is gym clothes, and I take my backpack and my books [ Oh, okay. ] and stuff like that.		
Randall: Okay and what is the first thing you do when you get to school?		
Joshua: We do “kiritsu, rei.”		
Randall: “Kiritsu” and “rei.” Now what are those?		
Joshua: It means “stand up, bow.”		
Randall: Stand up and bow.		
Joshua: Uh-huh.		
Randall: Okay, and what do you study at school?		
Joshua: We study kokugo, that is writing and reading and stuff like that [ Okay], and sansu, that’s math. [ Okay. ]. And, let’s see . . . , we do gym too.		
Randall: Okay, and where do you eat lunch? Do you have a lunchroom or cafeteria?		
Joshua: No, we eat in our classroom.		
Randall: You eat in your classroom! [ Yeah. ]. Oh wow. That is very interesting. Now what time do you come home from school?		
Joshua: We come home sometimes at 3:00 and sometimes at 2:00.		
Randall: Okay, well thank you very much Joshua.		
Joshua: You’re welcome.		
Police Officer: Hello. 24th Precinct. Officer Jones speaking.		
Man: Help. Yeah, uh, it was wild, I mean really bizarre.		
Police Officer: Calm down sir! Now, what do you want to report?		
Man: Well, I’d like to report a UFO sighting.		
Police Officer: A what?		
Man: What do you mean “what?” An unidentified flying object!		
Police Officer: Wait, tell me exactly what you saw.		
Man: Well, I was driving home from a party about three hours ago, so it was about 2:00 AM, when I saw this bright light overhead.		
Police Officer: Okay. And then what happened?		
Man: Oh, man. Well, it was out of this world. I stopped to watch the light when it disappeared behind a hill about a kilometer ahead of me.		
Police Officer: Alright. Then what?		
Man: Well, I got back in my car and I started driving toward where the UFO landed.		
Police Officer: Now, how do you know it was a UFO? Perhaps you only saw the lights of an airplane [No], or the headlights of an approaching car [No]. Things like that happen, you know.		
Man: Well if it was that, how do you explain “the BEAST”?		
Police Officer: What do you mean, “the BEAST”?		
Man: Okay. I kept driving for about five minutes when all of a sudden, this giant, hairy creature jumped out in front of my car.		
Police Officer: Oh, yeah. Then what?		
Man: Well, then, the beast picked up the front of my car and said, “Get out of the car. I’m taking you to my master!” Something like that.		
Police Officer: Wow? A hairy alien who can speak English! Come on!		
Man: I’m not making this up, if that’s what you’re suggesting. Then, when I didn’t get out of my car, the beast opened the car door, carried me on his shoulders to this round-shaped flying saucer, and well, that’s when I woke up alongside the road. The beast must have knocked me out and left me there.		
Police Officer: Well, that’s the best story I’ve heard all night, sir. Now, have you been taking any medication, drugs, or alcohol in the last 24 hours? You mentioned you went to a party.		
Man: What? Well, I did have a few beers, but I’m telling the truth.		
Police Officer: Okay, okay. We have a great therapist that deals with THESE kinds of cases.		
Man: I’m not crazy.		
Police Officer: Well, we’ll look into your story. Thank you.		
Security: Excuse me. Do you have any keys or money in your pockets?		
Passenger: No. No. I think I’ve taken everything out.		
Security: Okay. Go ahead and walk through the body scanner.		
Passenger: Will I feel anything?		
Security: No sir. Just walk through and keep your hands in the air.		
Passenger: Okay, uh, uh . . .		
[ Security alarm goes off . . . ]		
Security: We need to do some additional screening. Sorry, sir. Please come this way. [What? Did I . . . Did you find something?] Relax sir. Okay? I’m going to open your carry-on bag. [ Huh, huh?] As I’m going through it, please do not try to touch it. [But, I mean . . .uh] Let’s see now. Umm. First of all, sir, you can’t take any liquids like this bottled water past this point.		
Passenger: Ah. Well, I really can’t drink any other kind of water. Sierra Springs is the only bottled water I drink, and I . . .		
Security: Sorry sorry, sir. [Aoww ] And, sir. What’s this? [What?] No, no, sir. You cannot bring a lighter on the plane.		
Passenger: But I don’t smoke. I mean . . . [Well, you STILL can’t bring it on the plane.] But I have it just in case of emergencies. You know, as an emergency fire starter in case the plane crashes into a dark forest.		
Security: Sir. You’ll have to leave that here. What’s this?		
Passenger: Well . . .Oh. That’s my pocket knife.		
Security: A pocket knife? It’s almost a foot long!		
Passenger: Well, it’s a special knife given to me by my grandfather, but I only use it to peel apples and fruit. You know . . . . Things like that.		
Security: Sir. I’m sorry, but you can’t take that on the plane. In fact, do you have any other prohibited items in your bag? [Well, I don’t . . .] I mean, didn’t you read the sign back there explaining all the items that were not allowed on board?		
Passenger: Well, I started to read it, and I then got a little distracted.		
Security: A little? Sir. How many times have you flown on an airplane?		
Passenger: Uh, it’s been a while. I think the last time I traveled by plane was about, uh, 1960 . . .		
Security: Sir. Why don’t you come with me? [WHAT?] I think my supervisor would like to ask you a few questions.		
Passenger: Oh, no!		
Grandfather: Hey. Logan. How about some chocolate peanut butter milkshake? Yum,  yum, yum, yum, yum, yum . . . .		
Daughter: Dad. What are you feeding my child? [What?] He shouldn’t eat anything but rice and plain bread. He’s not supposed to eat anything else right now.		
Grandfather: Oh, this rice is so good, Logan. Yum, yuck, yuck.  Sorry, Logan. But hey, look. Your mom’s in the other room. Let’s forget the rice for a minute. One bite of this chocolate milkshake won’t hurt. Here. Take a small bite, no a BIG bite . . . yeah!		
Daughter: How does my child like the rice?		
Grandfather: Well. . . . Logan. Look. You have chocolate all over your face.  Let me clean up your face before your mom comes in here.		
Daughter: Dad. Is he not eating? Do I need to come in there?		
Grandfather: No, no, no. We’re fine. Thanks. Logan and I are just talking about politics, the stock market. You know, the economic turmoil in the world. Just light stuff like that.		
Daughter: Oh, yeah, that’s all he needs. I . . . I’m coming in there.		
Grandfather: No, no, no. No need. Oh . . .		
Daughter: Dad! What have you been giving him?		
Grandfather: We’ve just been sharing some of this chocolate rice, uh, milkshake!		
Daughter: You know it doesn’t come in flavors, right? It just comes in rice. Uh, look. Wash his face. We have to go to the store. Get him cleaned up.		
Grandfather: Okay. Logan. I guess I’ll have to finish the milkshake myself.		
Florist: Hi. May I help you?		
Customer: Yeah. Um. You see, I need some flowers for my wife, and uh, and, you know, I . . .		
Florist: Let . . . Let me guess. You forget your anniversary, and you’re trying to make things up, right?		
Customer: Oh. Yeah, is it that obvious?		
Florist: Well, yeah. We see men like you all the time that are so involved in their work that they simply forget about us.		
Customer: Well, in, in . . . in this case, it’s not like that.		
Florist: Sure. What do you need?		
Customer: Well, uh, I’d like to get a dozen roses with some greenery, and a very nice card.		
Florist: Do you really think a dozen roses is going to cut it?		
Customer: Well, yeah . . .		
Florist: I mean, if my husband forgot our anniversary, he’d be in the doghouse for sure. [Well . . . it’s . . . ] You need at least two dozen roses, a dozen balloons, and a romantic evening at an expensive restaurant.		
Customer: Well, I only have $10, and . . .		
Florist: Ten dollars? Well, that will buy you a single rose and a hamburger at McDonalds, but that’s it.		
Customer: Uh, wait. I actually have twelve dollars and, uh . . . wait, hang on, let me see here . . . thirty-two cents, so that might be . . .		
Florist: Forget playing golf this weekend. Your wife is way more important.		
Customer: Oh, no. OH, NO! My wife is out in the parking lot looking for me. Oh. And, and . . . she’s looking this way. PLEASE, PLEASE. Help me! She’ll wring my neck for sure.		
Florist: Okay, Okay. Uh, let’s see. Hum. [PLEASE, PLEASE!]. Well, well, it looks like I can arrange a small bouquet of roses. [Okay.] A couple are a little wilted [Oh, that’s okay.], but that’s the best I can do. [Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That’s fine.] And, and I can also attach a small card and tie a nice ribbon around the flowers.		
Customer: Oh, that would be great. You’re a lifesaver. I’ll put you on my Christmas card list forever.		
Florist: Okay. Okay. That’ll be twelve dollars even.		
Customer: You’re an angel. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, no. [What?] Now, she’s parked in front of your store waiting for me. I’m dead meat. Do you have a back door?		
Florist: No! It looks like you need to face the music and just talk to her. [I can’t, I can’t.] She’ll probably be very understanding after you promise you’ll wash . . . [You don’t know my wife.] Well, you need to promise to wash the dishes and clean the bathroom for the next six months. Get out there and be a man.		
Customer: Could you call an ambulance . . . just in case? This could get ugly.		
Florist: Men.
